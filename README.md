# `tinycalc`
A tiny calculator. The aim is to write it in a weekend (around other commitments) as a small project I can actually
"finish". It's also an opportunity to play around with [`chumsky`](https://crates.io/crates/chumsky) and
[`ariadne`](https://crates.io/crates/ariadne), two crates I've been wanting to try out.
